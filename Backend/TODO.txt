General Structure
    There is an employee login. People access different levels of
    information given their position in the company.
    You can also guest login to view job openings and general information
    about the company. Like a LinkedIn page but better.
    You can apply the jobs and the system automatically weeds out incompetent
    applications making things easier for the employer.
